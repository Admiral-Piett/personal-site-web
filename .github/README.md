# My Personal Site

Welcome to the code for my site!  This is intended to be a basic site to show some of the things I do, who I am, and 
what I'm working on.  It's written using React with of course HTML and friends.  It's hosted here: <TBD> using 
Google Cloud.  

This is only intended for personal use and referance for anyone else who's interested, so please be kind with what you 
find.  That said, stop by and say Hi!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and 
[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).
